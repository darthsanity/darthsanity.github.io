            <p>(also known as mom, hey you, oh no not her again, and that trainer chic depending on who you ask)<br>
                The lunatic asylum of over the phone IT helpdesk work no longer satisfied my need for frustration, banging my head again a brick wall, and figuring out fiddly little problems, so I moved to development. The new straight jack isnâ€™t fitting too badly!

            <h5 class="inside-headings">personal</h5>
                <p>The lovely world of geocities and competing with my brother to see who could make the most angsty, awful, neon colored website full of bad poetry and other teenage woes<br>
                    Also a purveyor of stories, on platforms such as Amazon, Smashwords, and various others, with the must have blogger blog to keep people up to date
                    </p>
            <h5 class="inside-headings">professional</h5>
                <p>IT helpdesk professional. Breaking and fixing things since 1998!<br>
                    During the course of that time, in various intervals, also in the same intervals there was taking over quality, training, knowledgebase, and Policy and Procedures. At the moment a Jack of All Trades, but not a master of one</p>
